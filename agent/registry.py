Named, parameterized prompt templates for the LLM agent. Each entry fills
{placeholders} at run time — lets a task run by name instead of typing a
fresh prompt each time. Execution is still the full LangGraph agent.

REPLY POLICY (applies to every comment/message reply task below,
regardless of whether it uses the browser or Graph API): factual
questions must be answered ONLY via answer_company_question (CRAG) —
never from general knowledge. Anything else gets a short, generic
acknowledgment only — no invented specifics, no claims not sourced from
the company knowledge base.
