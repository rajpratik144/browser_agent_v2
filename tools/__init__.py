"""
Single entry point for the agent's tools. To add a new tool category:
create a new file here (module-level list or a build_*(browser) factory),
import it below, and add it to build_tools()'s return list. Nothing
outside this package needs to know how any individual tool is
implemented. See docs/ADDING_FEATURES.md for a full walkthrough.
