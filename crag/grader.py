"""
Relevance grading: for each retrieved chunk, ask the LLM a focused yes/no
question — "is this chunk actually relevant to the question?" — using
structured output so the result is a reliable boolean, not free text to
parse. This is the "Corrective" part of CRAG: it's what lets the pipeline
notice bad retrieval instead of blindly trusting whatever came back.
