"""
Thin async client for Meta's Graph API. Every other module in graph_api/
(pages.py, instagram.py, leads.py) calls through graph_get()/graph_post()
here — same "one integration point" pattern as crag/engine.py.

Auth model: a Page Access Token authorizes calls made "as" that Page (and,
via its linked Instagram Business account, Instagram calls too). Get one
by:
    1. Log in via Facebook Login / Graph API Explorer as a Page admin,
       requesting whatever permissions you need (pages_manage_posts,
       instagram_content_publish, leads_retrieval, etc.)
    2. Exchange the short-lived user token for a long-lived one (60 days):
       GET /oauth/access_token?grant_type=fb_exchange_token&client_id=...
           &client_secret=...&fb_exchange_token=SHORT_LIVED_TOKEN
    3. GET /me/accounts with that long-lived user token — returns each
       Page you admin along with a Page Access Token that does NOT expire
       as long as the user token backing it stays valid.
Put the resulting Page Access Token in .env as FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN.
